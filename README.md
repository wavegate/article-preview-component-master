## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Creating tooltips and the arrows that go along with the tooltip.
- Show element on click and hide element when clicking off from it (only partially figured out).
- Changing SVG to white with `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)`
- Media queries with Javascript

### Continued development

I'm starting to recognize how messy CSS can become with different media queries and a lot of moving parts to have to manage, especially with media queries in the JavaScript as well. I may look to learn SASS/SCSS soon.
